HowTo

To compile CSharp on a Mac, I've been using Mono.
mcs <filename>.cs
This generates
filename.exe

To run the unit tests using NUnit is simple; NUnit ships with Mono.
Simply compile with an additional option:
mcs <filename>.cs -reference:nunit.framework.dll

To compile multiple files,
mcs /out:<filename> *.cs
